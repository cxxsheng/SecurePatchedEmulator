| :-------: | :------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
| 14.0.0_r1 |    2024-06     | [android-14.0.0_r1.zip](https://github.com/cxxsheng/SecurePatchedEmulator/releases/download/2024-06/android-14.0.0_r1.zip) |
| 12.0.0_r1 |    2024-06     | [android-12.0.0_r1.zip](https://github.com/cxxsheng/SecurePatchedEmulator/releases/download/2024-06/android-12.0.0_r1.zip) |

### Usage
To set up and launch the SecurePatchedEmulator, follow these steps:
1. Download the desired Android emulator image. For example, to launch `android-14.0.0_r1`:

   ```shell
   wget https://github.com/cxxsheng/SecurePatchedEmulator/releases/download/2024-06/android-14.0.0_r1.zip
   ```

2. Extract the downloaded zip file to the desired output directory:

   ```shell
   unzip android-14.0.0_r1.zip -d /path/to/emulator/
   ```

   Replace `/path/to/emulator` with the actual path where you want to extract the emulator files.

3. Launch the emulator, specifying the path to the extracted emulator directory:

   ```shell
   emulator @YourAVDName -sysdir /path/to/emulator/x86_64
   ```

   Replace `YourAVDName` with the name of your Android Virtual Device (AVD) and `/path/to/emulator` with the actual path where you extracted the emulator files. Ensure that the Android version used to create `YourAVDName` matches the Android version of the emulator image.

### Building
To create a secure Android emulator image with the latest security patches, follow these steps:

0. Initialize and sync the AOSP repository:
   ```shell
   repo init -u https://android.googlesource.com/platform/manifest -b android-14.0.0_r1
repo sync
   ```
   Replace `android-14.0.0_r1` with the desired Android version.

1. Identify the latest security patch tag from the[ `platform_build`](https://github.com/aosp-mirror/platform_build/tags ) repository on GitHub. For example, [`android-security-14.0.0_r9`](https://github.com/aosp-mirror/platform_build/releases/tag/android-security-14.0.0_r9):

2. Fetch the security patch tag across all AOSP repositories:

   ```shell
   2. repo forall -p -c 'git fetch aosp android-security-14.0.0_r9'
   ```

   Replace `android-security-14.0.0_r9` with the actual security patch tag.

3. Generate a diff file to review the changes between the current HEAD and the security patch:

   ```shell
   repo forall -p -c 'git log --oneline HEAD..FETCH_HEAD' > 14.0.0_r1-to-14.0.0_r9.diff.txt
   ```

4. Merge the security patch into the AOSP repositories:

   ```shell
   repo forall -p -c 'git merge FETCH_HEAD'
   ```

5. Modify the security patch date in the emulator image:

   In the `build/make/core/version_defaults.mk` file, locate the `ro.build.version.security_patch` variable and change its value to the desired security patch date, e.g., `2024-06-05`.

6. Build the Android emulator image: 

   For Android 13 and above:

   ```shell
   source ./build/envsetup.sh
   lunch sdk_phone_x86-userdebug
   make emu_img_zip -j$(nproc)
   ```

   This generates an `sdk-repo-linux-system-images-eng.[username]].zip` file.

   For Android 12 and below:

   ```shell
   source build/envsetup.sh
   lunch sdk_phone_x86_64-userdebug
   make -j$(nproc) sdk sdk_repo
   ```

   The `make sdk sdk_repo` command creates two files under `aosp-main/out/host/linux-x86/sdk/sdk_phone_x86_64`:

   - `sdk-repo-linux-system-images-eng.[username].zip`
   - `repo-sys-img.xml`
